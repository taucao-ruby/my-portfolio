## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a backend-oriented software engineer with a strong focus on building **reliable, scalable, and product-driven web systems**.

I graduated from **Passerelles Numériques Vietnam**, majoring in **Information Technology** with a specialization in **Software Development**. My education emphasized not only solid technical foundations, but also professionalism, teamwork, and effective communication in an international environment.

I primarily work on **backend and full-stack systems**, with a clear emphasis on backend architecture, system design, and long-term maintainability.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

I approach backend engineering with a **product mindset**.

Rather than focusing solely on feature implementation, I care deeply about how systems behave under **real-world conditions**, including:

- Concurrency and race conditions  
- Data consistency and transactional correctness  
- Validation, authorization, and access control  
- Failure scenarios and edge cases  
- Long-term extensibility and maintainability  

I strongly value systems where **clarity, correctness, and robustness** matter more than short-term delivery speed.

## 🏗️ Technical Focus

My experience includes designing and implementing:

- Clean application layers and well-structured domain models  
- Transaction-critical workflows (e.g. booking systems)  
- Maintainable backend architectures with clear separation of concerns  
- Secure and extensible APIs  
- Systems designed with future growth in mind  

I enjoy working on problems where **correctness and design quality are critical**, especially in revenue-impacting or data-sensitive systems.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Work Style

In my daily work, I value:

- Thoughtful technical discussions  
- Learning from experienced engineers  
- Taking responsibility for code quality and system behavior  
- Continuous improvement through reflection and iteration  

I prefer making **careful, well-reasoned technical decisions** that support long-term business value rather than temporary fixes.

## 🚀 Career Goals

**Short-term**  

- Continue growing as a backend software engineer  
- Deepen expertise in backend architecture and system design  
- Work in a stable, challenging engineering environment  

**Long-term**  

- Evolve into a **senior engineer or product-oriented technical leader**  
- Contribute to the design and evolution of complex, high-impact systems  

I take ownership of my growth through **structured planning, disciplined execution, and continuous learning**.
